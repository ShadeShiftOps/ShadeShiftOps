# <h1>Aspiring Ethical Hacker</h1>

## <h4>Hello and welcome to ShadeShiftOps! This is where you'll find everything related to my programming journey from beginner to professional! Take a look around and feel free to reach out to me for whatever reason! I'm open to collaboration on anything Cyber Security related and I'm always interested in learning more from anyone, no matter how experienced.</h4>

## <h4>I am an aspiring Ethical Hacker currently learning Python before I move on to learning C. My primary interests involve C2 frameworks and evasion, but if you're working on anything Cyber Security related and you feel like I'd be an asset to your group, please let me know and reach out! Cyber Security is my passion and Ethical Hacking is my goal.</h4>
